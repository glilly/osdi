<DESCRIPTION>With the dantrolene administered via IV: cases of fatal ventricular fibrillations are constantly observed in animals when verapamil and dantrolene are administered via IV. The administration of a calcium channel blocker and dantrolene is thus potentially dangerous. However, some patients have received nifedipine and dantrolene together without incident</DESCRIPTION>
