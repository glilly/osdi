<p><b>ANTIARRHYTHMIC AGENTS</b></p>

<p><b>Numerous antiarrhythmics are depressors of reflexes, of cardiac conduction and contractility.</b></p>

<p><b>The administration of different classes of antiarrhythmics can have a beneficial therapeutic effect, but most often proves very delicate, requiring strict clinical monitoring and EKG. The administration of antiarrhythmics that cause torsades de pointes (amiodarone, disopyramide, quinidines, sotalol...) with other antiarrhythmics is contraindicated.</b></p>

<p><b>The administration of antiarrhythmics of the same class is not recommended, aside from exceptional cases, because of the increased risk of undesirable cardiac effects.</b></p>

<p><b>The administration together of medications having negative inotropic properties, those causing bradycardia, and/or those that slow atrioventricular conduction is delicate and requires clinical monitoring and EKG.</b></p>
