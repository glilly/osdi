<p><b>MEDICATIONS THAT LOWER THE EPILEPTIC THRESHOLD</b></p>

<p><b> The combination of proconvulsant medications, or those that lower the epileptic threshold, must be carefully weighed, because of the severity of the risk they pose. These medications are represented especially by most of the antidepressants (tricyclic, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), the neuroleptics (phenothiazides and butyrophenones), mefloquin, chloroquin, the fluoroquinolones, bupropion, tramadol)</b></p>
